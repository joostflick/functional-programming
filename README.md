# OBA API USER

## Day 1
Installed Rijks module to make node.js calls to the oba API. 
```node
$ npm install rijkvanzanten/node-oba-api
```
This also turns the xml into a json object.
Modified the code with 
```js
fs.writeFile('myjsonfile.json', res, 'utf8')
```
to be able to take a better look at the results of my search queries.

### 5 possible research cases:

* first
* second
* third
* fourth
* fifth
