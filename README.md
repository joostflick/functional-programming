[Old document with more code examples](README-code.md)

[Old README before redo](README-old.md)

## Installation & usage

1. Download the project
2. Run `npm install`
3. To change the query edit the query var in index.js
4. Run `npm start`
5. Open docs/index.html in your browser

I implemented the following commands:

`npm run build` runs browserify to make my application usable in a browser environment

`npm run data` makes a get request to retrieve new data and add it to the d3 environment

`npm start` runs both of the above commands, first retrieving data then building the app so it can be displayed in the browser

## What did I change for the redo?

#### After:

### Browserify

I added browserify to be able to display external data in my d3 graph. This way it's possible to just use one script to retrieve data and display it.

### Code quality

I removed the long pieces of code to calculate percentages using a lot of magic numbers from my API logic, and moved it to my d3 file. This made it possible to use d3 functionality like nest() to clean my data more easily.

### % per query

I changed the functionality of the application to display the percentage difference between the languages per query, instead of per year. The title automatically changes based on the query that is used.

This gives valuable insights I could have used during front-end data.

### Mouse events & colors

I added a tooltip when hovering a bar, showing the percentage and language. This data will also be displayed on top of the graph when clicking one of the bars. Also each language is now assigned a color.

### Animations

I added a simple entrance animation for the bar chart.

## Functionality of the application

Display the distribution of all languages for a certain query. The user can interact with the bars to see the exact percentages.

When adding the year: query this could form a base for my research case in which I try to find correlations between certain queries and how their language distribution has changed over the years.

## Data usage

My get request fills an Array with book instances sorted by year which have the following properties:

- ID
- query
- title
- language
- year
- author

At the moment my application only uses the language field in combination with the amount of times that language exists in the dataset. This way I can calculate the percentages to display in the bar chart.

Although the rest of the fields of the book objects aren't used at the moment, they could be used to give the user more details about certain books in further iterations in the future.

## Pain points

- D3 functionality, converting blocks or observables to something I can use
- Finding a convenient way to get my data to the browser to be used for my graphs (using localhost or browserify?)
- Converting data to usable formats (this got a little easier when I moved my data cleaning logic to my d3 file)
- Using D3 selectors and nesting and the combination of those two

## What would I have done differently if I had more time

- Being able to make GET requests from the browser to be able to see the data change in real time
- Styling
- Using more of the data fields to give the user a more indepth look in why certain themes are more popular in certain languages
- Making a dropdown to select the year to display (implemented in my [Frontend data repo](https://github.com/joostflick/frontend-data))
- Using a wrapper like wouter made, or at least a more conform way to handle the get requests. Although I like the fact that I wrote this one myself it is far from perfect.

## Some insights

- D3 can do a lot, but takes time getting used to (different ways of nesting, which selector selects what)
- console logging everything that doesnt do what it should helps(both responses from get requests and selectors not doing what I want them to)
- Even though it's only about two weeks after first submitting this application, I immediately saw a lot of things I would have done differently now
